/**
 * Problem 14 from Project Euler
 *
 * The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
 * n -> n/2 (n is even)
 * n -> 3n + 1 (n is odd)
 *
 * Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
 *
 * 13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
 *
 * It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms, Although it has not been proved yet
 * ( Collazt Problem), it is toughr that all starting numbers finish at 1.
 *
 * Which starting number, under one million, procude the longest chain?
 *
 * NOTE: Once the chain start the terms are allowed to go above one million.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE
 * In order to compile you must have gcc, or similar, installed
 *
 * REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE
 * This is not the final version of the script, it can be improved any time. 
 * If you have a better solution please submit a pull request or open an issue
 * on Github
