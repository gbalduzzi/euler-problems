/**
 * Problem 6 from Project Euler
 *
 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *  1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
 * The square of the sum of the first the natural numbers is,
 *  (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE
 * In order to compile this file you must have gcc, or similar, installed on your machine
 *
 * REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE
 * This is not the final version of the algorithm, it's improvable and it always will be. If you have any suggestion or a better
 * algorithm please submit a pull request or open an issue on Github.
