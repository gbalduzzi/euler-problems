/**
 * Problem 31 from Project Euler
 *
 * In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:
 *
 * 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).
 * It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
 *
 * 1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p
 * How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE
 * In order to compile you must have gcc, or similar, installed
 *
 * REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE
 * This is not the final version of the Algorithm, anyone can improve it.
 * If you have a better solution please submit a pull request, or an issue,
 * on github.
