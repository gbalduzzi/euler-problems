/**
 * Problem 34 from Project Euler
 * 145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.
 *
 * Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.
 *
 * Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE
 * In order to compile you must have gcc, or similar, installed
 *
 * REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE
 * This is not the final version of the algorithm, anyone can improve it.
 * If you have a better solution please submit a pull request, or an issue,
 * on Github.
