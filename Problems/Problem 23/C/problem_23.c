/**
 * Problem 23 from Project Euler
 *
 * A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisord is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the
 * proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.
 *
 * A number n is called deficient it the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant it this sum exceeds n.
 *
 * As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundants is 24.
 * By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater thatn 28123 can be written as the sum of two
 * number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less that this limit.
 *
 * Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE
 * In order to compile you must have gcc, or similar, installed
 *
 * REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE
 * This is not the final versione of the Algorithm, anyone can improve it.
 * If you have a better solution please submit a pull request, or an issue, on Github.
