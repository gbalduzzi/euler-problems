/**
 * Problem 46 on Project Euler
 *
 * It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
 *
 * 9 = 7 + 2×1^2
 * 15 = 7 + 2×2^2
 * 21 = 3 + 2×3^2
 * 25 = 7 + 2×3^2
 * 27 = 19 + 2×2^2
 * 33 = 31 + 2×1^2
 *
 * It turns out that the conjecture was false.
 *
 * What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE
 * In order to compile this Algorithm you must have gcc, or similar, installed.
 *
 * REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE
 * This is not the final version of the script, anyone can improve it.
 * If you have a better solution please submit a pull request, or an issue, on Github.
