/**
 * Problem 30 from Project Euler
 *
 * Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:
 * 
 * 1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4
 * 8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4
 * 9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4
 * 
 * As 1 = 1^4 is not a sum it is not included.
 * 
 * The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.
 * Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE
 * In order to compile you must have gcc, or similar, installed
 *
 * REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE
 * This is not the final Algorithm, anyone can improve it.
 * If you have a better solution please submit a pull request,
 * or an issue, on Github.

// First af all we need to determine what is the bigger number from this expression
// n * 9^5. 
// We know that 9^5 gives us 59049 so, because of the problem, we can do something like
// 5 * 9^5 which gives us 295245 for five digits
// Maybe this is not the fastest approach but it works
#define POWER 5
#define DIGITS 5
#define MAX (int)((DIGITS + 1) * pow(9, POWER)) // Our limit will be greater than the result of the actual limit.
