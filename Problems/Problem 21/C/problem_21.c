/**
 * Problem 21 from Project Euler
 *
 * Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evently into n)
 * if d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a != b, then a and b are amicable pair and each of a and be are called amicable numbers
 *
 * For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(200) = 284.
 * The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
 *
 * Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers unders 10000.
 *
 * PLASE NOTE
 * In order to compile you must have gcc, or similar, installed
 *
 * REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE
 * This is not the final version of the algorithm, anyone can improve it.
 * If you have a better solution please submit a pull request, or an issue, on Github.
