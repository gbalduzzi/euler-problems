/**
 * Problem 19 from Project Euler
 *
 * You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.
 *  - 1 Jan 1990 was a Monday
 *  - Thirty days has September,
 *    April, June and November.
 *    All the rest have thirty-one,
 *    Saving February alone,
 *    Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
 *    And on leap years, twenty-nine.
 *  - A leap year occours on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
 *
 * How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
