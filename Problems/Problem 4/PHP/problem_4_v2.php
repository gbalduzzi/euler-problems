/**
 *
 * Problem 4 from Project Euler
 *
 * A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
 * Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
 *
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE
 * In order to test this script you must have PHP 5.3+ installed and php-cli, to test it with a terminal.
 *
 * REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE
 * This is not the final version, as you can see I'll trace the version of every solution, so please don't think that
 * this is the best algorithm in terms of speed and code optimization, for any trouble open an issue.
 *
 * @author Santo Antonio Terranova (@tng46)
 * @version 1.1.0
 * 
 * For isPalindrome() function i prefer String approach.
 * I have increased algorithm performance by simply changing the conditions order.
 * Try to flip order to see the difference.
